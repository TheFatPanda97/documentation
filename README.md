# Cobalt Documentation

Cobalt is a collection of open data web APIs that allow you to interface with public information from the University of Toronto.

The goal with Cobalt is to foster a culture of open data at the university. Cobalt's web APIs are free to use and also free to [contribute](./getting-started/contributing.md) to.
