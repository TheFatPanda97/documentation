# Contributing

Cobalt is designed to foster a culture of open data and open source at the university. Cobalt's web APIs are free to use and also free to contribute to.

## Repositories

[Cobalt](https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/cobalt): The web service that powers the web APIs. Built with Node.js and interfaces with MongoDB for high performance querying over JSON-like data structures. (a [detailed guide](https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/cobalt/wiki) on contributing to this repository is available).

[UofT Scrapers](https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/uoft-scrapers): The web scraping modules that populate Cobalt's databases. Built with Python and also distributed as a PyPI module.

[Cobalt Documentation](https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/documentation): Documentation for Cobalt, written in Markdown. Readable from within GitHub and on the [website](https://cobalt.qas.im/documentation).

## Branching strategy

For all repositories, there is one `master` branch. For each stable release, a new tag is created (ex. `0.1.0`).

## Issue tracker

We use GitHub issue tracking. Each repository will have outstanding issues/suggestions listed in the Issues tab.

## Pull requests

Each pull request should only contain one new feature/improvement, and should always be submitted to the `master` branch.

## Code style

Please make sure that any pull request you submit abides by the code style guides mentioned below.

For JavaScript, we follow the [JavaScript Standard](http://standardjs.com/) code style.

For Python, we follow the [PEP 0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code style.

If you find any inconsistencies in the current codebase, please do bring it up and feel free to submit a pull request fixing it.
